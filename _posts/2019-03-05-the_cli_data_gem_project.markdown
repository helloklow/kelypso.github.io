As the first opportunity to really nurture our own brainchild, I've thoroughly enjoyed the process of building something from start to finish. Devising my very own workflow (admittedly, vastly influenced by Avi's instructional videos :)) and tackling decision-making and problem-solving with my own code, firsthand, has been both deeply challenging and rewarding. In the end, I believe there were four distinct resources that truly helped to keep this project clear, engaging, and fun for me - even in the most difficult moments.

1. Watch Avi's [CLI Gem Walkthrough](http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lDExWIhYKI)
You can (and will) thank me later. This video is the CLI Data Gem Bible. Whether not sure where to start, confused by the file structure, lost in your logic, or in need of a dose of clarity and confidence, Avi's walkthrough is a valuable resource for keeping yourself on track with this project. 

2. Stay Simple
It's probably quite natural to get a little excited and over-zealous when the starting gates finally fly open. I know I certainly had some lofty aspirations for my project at the start. Even after watching Avi's walkthrough, I figured it would be no problem to add my own extra neat functionality here or there... But a complete and robust *small* program is by far better than one that is fancy but finicky. 

3. Plan and Pseudocode
I took quite a bit of time to meticulously plan my project before getting started. I thoroughly mapped out my program in pseudocode and invested time in analyzing and refactoring my pseudocode. I wanted a crystal clear understanding of what I needed to program so that I wouldn't get lost or overwhelmed once I started.

4. Choose a Project Your Actually Passionate About
Besides Avi's video, I think the most valuable resource for success in this project is simply choosing something that you are honestly passionate about working on. As an avid rock climber, I chose this as my subject matter. That made the project something truly useful to me, and I approached it with the perspective that I may want to build upon it later. This meant coding as cleanly as possible - As Avi would remind us, closed for modification, but open for extension :)
