Focus has been failing me recently. I have, admittedly, been juggling a bit too much, but my usual ambition and motivation have just been feeling somewhat off. After moving to a new state and settling into a balanced work/study/life routine, I began a new job with a whole new schedule a few weeks ago. I also had (both surprise and planned) visitors staying with me three weekends in a row, which, while wonderful and fulfilling, was exhausting and far from productive. Needless to say, these exciting events have taken a toll and thrown my routines out of whack. So I've been searching for solutions to the exhaustion and distractions that are constantly abound.

There are two things that seem to help me ground and refocus the most. First is simply taking a few steps back. I've realized that trying to push forward with new material when I'm utterly inattentive is just so futile and serves no real gain. Instead, I've found that backing up a few lessons and jumping in with a lab that's somewhat familiar can really get the gears turning. If I'm unable to focus on a lab, often one of the review videos will do the trick, getting me engaged and excited to jump into a lab. 

Apart from backing up to something more basic, consistency is truly the key to reclaiming my focus and motivation. When I keep myself engaged regularly, even just a small amount each day, it's significantly easier to pick back up more readily - without reviewing. The inspiration and motivation also come more naturally, along with the steady progress. So I suppose it's simply a matter of doing my best to really honor and implement these tenets each day moving forward :)
