For the Sinatra project, I built an application called ClimbTime, which allows users to save and update information about their rock climbing projects and achievements. From the start, this project simultaneously made me realize both how much I've learned and how far I still have to go. I quickly found that certain skills, such as setting up the file structure and troubleshooting, have improved markedly, while other skills, such as maintaining a diligent attention to detail when mapping routes, will require quality practice to feel confident with. 

As I reflect back on this project, as with the CLI gem project, again I find myself considering the resources that were most valuable for maintaining my purpose and sanity with this project. While some of these insights are becoming a clear trend for achieving a successful project, I also stumbled upon some valuable ways to gain new perspectives when the mind-melt sets in. 

**Choose a Project that's Meaningful to You**
I can't reiterate this one enough. If you build something you feel you may truly utilize, it lifts some of the burden of the "project" off of your shoulders and turns it into something valuable to you. It becomes less about meeting requirements and more about personal edification. This project presents an easy opportunity to choose a subject that you're genuinely interested in. Most hobbies, interests, or passions can be broken down into an MVC structure, so get creative! 

**Use and Abuse Your Application**
It's easy to think you've got this whole app thoroughly mapped out because you've practiced it *oh so many* times in labs by now and you're keeping it simple, anyway. However few things are more frustrating (and humbling) than confidently running your app, only to find that nothing works how you intended. Use and abuse your app *constantly*... Like, as-often-as-you-save-your-code kind of constantly. If you're saving, may as well test it out, too!

**Get Outside Input**
I felt that this was an unexpcted and deeply valuable resource for this project. Being that it's user-based, showing the project to other climbers, aka potential users, illicted valuable feedback, particularly with form design and data views. As a developer, it's appealing to try to take the easy way out in some instances, or vice-versa, to implement complex functionality where users don't truly find it necessary. Getting end-user feedback simply helps to polish and launch a better quality application.

**Ask for Help Often**
Asking for help is a little bit like self-discipline. It gets easier to do the more often you practice it. What's harder is knowing *when* to ask for help. I tend to tough it out and try to work through problems until I'm thoroughly overwhlemed. I'm here to tell you that this is not the way to learn and improve your skillset! Ask early and ask often. You never know how long a reply may take and you can still attempt troubleshooting on your own while you wait. Don't limit yourself to instructors or Google, either. Reach out to fellow students - The power of another set of eyes can never be underestimated.
