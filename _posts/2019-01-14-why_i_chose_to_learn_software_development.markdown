It was a sweltering summer day sometime in July of 2018. I was sitting at my desk in Ojai, a groovy little gem of a town that's nestled amongst the orange and avocado groves of Ventura County, California. I was trying to find something, *anything* to work on to preoccupy my mind from the unsettling boredom I was trapped in. I briefly caught myself daydreaming of the days when I worked from home for Polaris-Danforth Corporation. Man, it sure was awesome to be able to squeeze and snuggle with my cat whenever I was having a stressful work day...

My curiosity piqued. What was it that really made that position so fulfilling? Polaris-Danforth is a small group of healthcare consultants who customize electronic medical records and build interfaces between those record systems and the medical equipment that's strapped to your body. I began as an administrative assistant and quickly started learning MEL. As I grew into a junior consultant, I began taking on small coding assignments and troubleshooting projects. The more I learned, the more rewarding the work became. Sure, I might spend half a day debugging one form, but the fulfillment when that one problem was finally solved brought such pure elation that it's nearly incomparable. It gave me a sense of pride and kept me humble at the same time.

By the end of July, I was obsessed with redefining my career path. I had far surpassed both my ability to grow as well as my tolerance for boredom in my current position. Recalling my recent insights, I began revisiting programming through online resources. Feeling that I would love the combined creativity and rationality of web development, I put a lot of learning into HTML and CSS. I enjoyed the challenges of learning new languages and the validation of writing code that's both functional and aesthetic. 

While I was having a lot of fun getting my feet wet with web development, something in the back of my mind kept pestering me. A little thought kept popping up, saying that as fun as front end web development is, I want something more. I remember hearing my coworkers at Polaris-Danforth occasionally talk of "databases" and "the back end". I began trying to learn more about these things and simultaneously, I began a new journey learning JavaScript. 

Right away JavaScript intrigued me in new and exciting ways. I was quickly becoming convinced that programming was the next step for me. As I learned more about the different types of development, I uncovered that full-stack development seemed to be the perfect niche for me. It put to rest that small, nagging feeling of wanting more while incorporating some of the skills I'd already started to learn and love. So the research continued... and ultimately brought me to Flatiron. 

Over the past month as I've worked through the Bootcamp Prep and Pre-Course Work, my resolve has only solidified and my passion and excitement have only grown. I can’t wait to see what challenges and triumphs lie ahead. The best part is, there’s no time to be bored when there’s always more to learn :)
