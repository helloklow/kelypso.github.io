With this chance to build our own brainchild, I experienced an unexpected number of twists and turns from start to finish. Exploring my own workflow and tackling decision-making and problem-solving with my own code has been both deeply challenging and rewarding. In the end, there were five resources that truly helped to keep this project clear, engaging, and fun - even in the most difficult moments.


**Watch Avi’s CLI Gem Walkthrough** 

You can (and will) thank me later. This video is the CLI Data Gem Bible. Whether not sure where to start, confused by the file structure, lost in your logic, or in need of a dose of clarity and confidence, Avi’s walkthrough is a valuable resource for keeping yourself on track with this project.


**Stay Simple** 

It’s probably kind of natural to get a little excited and over-zealous when the starting gates finally fly open. I know I certainly had some lofty aspirations for my project at the start. Even after watching Avi’s walkthrough, I figured it would be no problem to whip up something even flashier… But a complete and robust small program is by far better than one that is fancy but finicky.


**Plan, Pseudocode, Test, Break, Repeat...** 

I tried to meticulously plan my project before getting started. I mapped out my program as many ways as I could, trying to anticipate where I'd have trouble. I wanted a thorough understanding of what I needed to do in the hope that I wouldn’t get lost or overwhelmed with this blueprint to guide me. What I learned is that blueprints are really more like preliminary sketches - They're a wonderful foundation, but the final product always has its differences. It's the nature of programming that things will break, so when they do, shake it off and start planning again. 


**Choose a Project Your Actually Passionate About** 

I think that an undervalued resource for success with this project is simply choosing something that you are truly passionate about working on. As an avid rock climber, I chose that as my subject matter. It made this project something truly useful to me and I approached it with the perspective that I may want to build upon it later.


**Ask for Help Often**

You may think that you're stuck on something small. You may think that it will just take one more evening of looking at to figure out. However having another set of eyes confirm your thoughts is NEVER a bad thing! After spending a week on my program and having continued issues, I finally reached out for help and learned that the website I was using just wouldn't work. With the clock ticking down, I moved forward with redoing my project. Through this process, I realized that I'm capable of a little bit more than I thought I was...and I'm definitely capable of a lot more than I was just two months ago.
